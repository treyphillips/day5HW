Create [merkle trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) from directories.

## Example

Let's create a merkle tree from the `test/fixtures` folder:

```js
var merkle = require('merkle-dir');

merkle(__dirname, function(err, tree) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(tree, null, '  '));
});
```

And the tree is:

```bash
$ node example.js
{
  "path": "",
  "hash": "79d8ca8a1c6e37271a7c846246a0035e46cf3705a0024d01f830bc77c9e7c6a7",
  "tree": [
    {
      "path": "a",
      "hash": "bbfadafe6ae91a4b0311ad83ceac22e965ce7efd181c493e0d2339197449d769",
      "tree": [
        {
          "path": "a/file.txt",
          "hash": "197e199545eca4b58d335b7e671871a63e4e5b3ca6361cfa9605b654bc3bbfa1"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "path": "b",
      "hash": "e9e3596a701f0edb0c80e9d0bd147e223c1f965f0aef388844222c1140fbaec3",
      "tree": [
        {
          "path": "b/file.txt",
          "hash": "f1523727794b3bed803486a4b10b46962696e0401bcf94f995078577cbbff3cf"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "path": "c",
      "hash": "bbfadafe6ae91a4b0311ad83ceac22e965ce7efd181c493e0d2339197449d769",
      "tree": [
        {
          "path": "c/ahoi.txt",
          "hash": "197e199545eca4b58d335b7e671871a63e4e5b3ca6361cfa9605b654bc3bbfa1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## API

### merkle(directory, fn)

Create a merkle tree covering `directory` and call `fn` with the possible error
and the tree.

Nodes have those keys:

* `path`: the path relative to the root `directory`
* `hash`: the hex encoded `sha256` hash of the file or its subtree
* `tree`: the subtree, exists only if the node is a *directory*

## Use cases

* **hash an entire directory**: If you just use `tree.hash` you get the hash
of an entire directory and all its folders and subdirectories.
* **diff directories**: Traverse the directory breadth-first to quickly find
out what files differ, in `O(|V| + |E|)` time.

## TODO

* what to hash with file nodes([#1](https://github.com/juliangruber/merkle-dir/issues/1))
* handle links ([#2](https://github.com/juliangruber/merkle-dir/issues/2))
* move to a binary tree? depends on diffing algorithm ([#3](https://github.com/juliangruber/merkle-dir/issues/3))

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install merkle-dir
```
